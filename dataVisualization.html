      <p>
        The idea of analyzing the U.S. real estate market came in to my mind because I am passionate about how the U.S. house price trend changes and how it affects our life. There are many times that I want to know if investment of a house in location A is valuable or not at that time. It's interesting to hear from friends around me saying that who buys a house and then the house price increases in the otehr year, or, unluckily, decreases due to some reasons. So I am very curious about how the U.S. house price changed over these years. <br/><br/>Therefore, I decided to do a project to analyze the overall U.S. house price trend in the U.S. by creating a <b>D3v5 proportional symbol map</b>.<br/><br/>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>

    <p>
      This D3v5 proportional symbol map, "U.S. House Sale Prices Ten Years Growth Trend" analyzes the U.S. house growth trend from March 2009 to December 2018, which is approximately a 10 year trend.

    </p>

    <h3>Interactivities</h3>
    <p>
      a) The user can visualize the size of each single bubble as each city's ten-year sales price difference.
      <br/><br/>
      <!-- b) By selecting a drop down box, the user has two options of visualizations: U.S. house sales price and U.S. house rental price.
      <br/><br/> -->

      b) When the user mouses over a single state, the name of the state will be shown.
      <br/><br/>
      c) When the user mouses over a single bubble, the bubble will show a more specific bar chart which represents that specific city's year by year sales/rental price difference. At the same time, the city name, state name where the city is at, and the ten-year house price difference of that bubble/city will be dispalyed in the top of the map.
    </p>
    <h3>What Can We Learn from the Visualization?</h3>

    <p>
      We can learn a lot from this interactive visualization. Although if I do not look at details, I still can visualize that "San Jose" has the biggest 10 year house sales price difference among the whole U.S., when I mouse over the bubble representing "San Jose", which is the biggest bubble in CA(or the U.S.), I can see that the house sales price in the year 2010~2011 from the yearly price difference bar chart is, interestingly, decreasing.      </p>

      <br/>
      🔗<b>One TopoJSON Dataset</b>
      <br/><br/>

      <b><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922" >Basic US State Map - D3</a></b> - In order to implement U.S. state boundaries, I used the D3 data by author Michelle Chandra.

      🔗<b>Two CSV Datasets</b>

      <br/><br/>

      In order to analyze the trend of the real estate market from different perspectives, I collected the data from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/" ><b>Zillow Research Data</b></a>.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Data license</b> can be found <a href="https://www.zillow.com/corp/Terms.htm" >here</a>.
      <br/><br/>
      More specifically, I chose the subject of <b>Home Listings and Sales</b> from the website data page. I downloaded the dataset by filtering "Data Type" as "Median Sale Price - Seasonally Adjusted ($)" and "Geography" as "Metro & U.S.".
      <br/><br/>
      At the same time, I also chose <b>Rental Listings</b> from the website as my second analysis target. I downloaded the dataset by filtering "Home Type" as "Median List Price ($) - 2-Bedroom" and "Geography" as "Metro & U.S.".

      <br/><br/>

      <b>Home Listings and Sales</b> - "Zillow provides data on sold homes, including median sale price for various housing types, sale counts (for which there’s detailed methodology), and foreclosures provided as a share of all sales in which the home was previously foreclosed upon. There is also current and historical for-sale listings data, ranging from median list prices and inventory counts to share of listings with a price cut, median price cut size, age of inventory, and the days a listing spent on Zillow before the sale was final. Inventory and other housing data also are available for local markets."

      <br/><br/>

      <b>Rental Listings</b> - "Zillow Rent Index (ZRI): A smoothed measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type. ZRI is a dollar-denominated alternative to repeat-rent indices. Zillow publishes ZRI and other housing data for local markets as well as its ZRI methodology."

      <br/><br/>
      **According to the description of both datasets, Zillow has already done the <b>seasonal adjustment</b> by using <a href="https://www.census.gov/srd/www/x13as/">The X-13ARIMA-SEATS Seasonal Adjustment</a> from <a href="https://www.census.gov/en.html">United States Census Bureau</a>.
      <br/>
    </p>
    <h3>2️⃣ Raw Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      <br/>
      <b>1. D3 Map with States and Countries</b>
      <br/><br/>
      a) I converted the raw data "D3 Map with States and Countries" from <b>.topojson</b> into <b>.geojson</b> format by using this <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/enjalot/63d06e2ccadad0cb30dc5f920efd1cdf">online converter</a> by Ian Johnson.
      <br/>
      b) I manually edited all the full names of U.S. states into abbreviations by using <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad ++</a>. For example, "California" -> "CA". I do so in order to combine "State" column in the <i>us_states.geojson</i> file with my other 2 datasets from Zillow.
      <br/><br/>
      (file source: <i>us_states.geojson</i>)
      <br/><br/>
      <b>2. Home Listings and Sales</b>
      <br/><br/>
      a) I parsed one column with the format of [City, State] into two separate columns named "city" and "state" by using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Python Pandas library</a>. For example, [San Francisco, CA] -> [San Francisco], [CA].
      <br/>
      b) In order to generate "longitude" and "latitude" columns, I imported the two datasets on <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>, and the "longidue" and "latitude" are generated.
      <br/>
      c) I generated one more "TenYrSalesDiff" column, which stands for ten-year U.S. house sales price difference of each city in the U.S., by using the difference between each house price from Dec 2011 and each house price from Mar 2009.
      <br/>
      d) Moreover, in order to generate each city's yearly sales price difference, I generated 9 more columns, which are year by year sales price differences from Dec 2011 to Mar 2019.
      <br/>
      e) For the second visualization, I generated the tenYrGrowRate, which stands for a ten-year U.S. sales price growth rate.
      <br/>
      <i>How to Calculate Growth Rate
        <br/>
        Let:
        <br/>
        <b>P(A)</b> = House A's Price 10 Years Before
        <br/>
        <b>g</b> = Growth Rate in 10 Years
        <br/>
        <b>P'(A)</b> = Present House A's Price
        <br/>
        👉🏼Price of House A after 10 Years is: P'(A) = P(A)*(1 + g)%
        <br/>
        👉🏼<b>Formula - Growth Rate, g, of House A after 10 Years is: g = P'(A)/P(A)*100 - 100</b></i>
        <br/><br/>
        (file source: <i>SalesDifference.csv</i>)
        <br/><br/>
        <b>3. Rental Listings</b>
        <br/><br/>
        Since this dataset has overlapped columns with <b>2. Home Listings and Sales</b>, all processing steps are the same as above.
        <br/><br/>
        (file source: <i>RentalDifference.csv</i>)
